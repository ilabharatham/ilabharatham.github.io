### Introduction

ILA BHARATHAM was born for making the nation a better place to live in, by extending our support to the needy from different horizons. Our emphasis is to assist the needs of the children in a right way, helping them to flourish in their talents. We value the operational freedom which stems from being a non-profitable trust which is independent of any religious or political affiliation and which does not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, age, religion or politics.

### Mission

To unite the younger generation for a noble cause and to increase the awareness among people, encourage them to provide a helping hand and the imbalance in todays rapidly changing world needs to be put back into equilibrium.

### Vision

Ilabharatam was born not just out of curiosity but out off concern to help the under priviledged people in the society.Its emphasis is to ensure that every child gets a proper life with good benefits. It strives for the welfare of the differently abled children and nurtures them in all possible ways so as to make them independent.
