Iâ€™m Vishnu, a 21st century hillbilly from the misty hills of Kodai. A Programmer, Photographer, Gamer, NGO-activist and most important of all I'm a Human Being! even though Most of my Friends Will Deny the Fact that I'm one.

##Programmer

The first Script that I wrote was to copy the contents of a Folder and paste it in a shared Folder. I started programming with Python Learned some webframeworks on it and that's when My life as a programmer started and i've been a learner ever since . learning php, perl, java, clojure and now towards scala.

##Photographer

From my childHood I've always wanted to capture the moments and places I've been to share it with others photography has always been a passion. Never took a class on it and never will i just love taking pictures.

##Once a Gamer always a Gamer

I just Love playing PC Games anything and everything that would run in my PC from RoadRash to FarCry-4.
