We the team members of Ila Bharatham had organised an house-keeping campaign in Louis Brailie Blind School of Poonamallee. We planted samplings to make the enviornment greener.

If you want to know what made this organisation come to life you sholud certainly visit this place . The only government School for the Gifted.

This place has been our stepping stone many here with us have this school as inspiration for our volunteering work.The children here are so filled with inocence that even the cooldest hearts would melt in their presence .the building where they live in is an old british building that was built during the 19th century .
